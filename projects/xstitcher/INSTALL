Installing xstitcher.

DEPENDENCIES
To build xstitcher you will need the following libraries:
- boost (http://www.boost.org)
- Qt (http://qt.nokia.com)
- Vigra (http://hci.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/vigra)
- arxlib (http://code.google.com/p/arxlib)
- ImageMagick (http://www.imagemagick.org)
- Eigen (http://eigen.tuxfamily.org)
- Glut (http://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/glut)

The former two are required in order to build palette viewer.
You don't need to build Vigra since xstitcher uses header-only subset of this library.


BUILDING UNDER WINDOWS
Visual studio solution file is located in winbuild folder. Just open it and run "Build Solution".

Trying to link xstitcher applications statically with all the used libraries (including C runtime) may be non-trivial.
1. When configuring boost, pass --build-type=complete to bjam in order to build all possible configurations (including static ones).
2. For building static version of Qt, see http://www.qtcentre.org/wiki/index.php?title=Building_static_Qt_on_Windows.
3. To build static version of ImageMagick, be sure to select "Static Multi-threaded runtimes" when configuring VisualMagick.


BUILDING UNDER UNIX/LINUX
To build any of the applications in this package, you can simply type:
> qmake -f <app-name>.pro
> make
